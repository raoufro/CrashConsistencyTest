Requirements
---------------
- mariadb/mysql
- sysbench >= 1.0.5
- build dependencies of tarballs in src

Configurations
---------------
#cd CrashConsistencyTest
Setup "config" file based on samples in configs/* and your preferences
Add your blacklists of xfstests based on excludes/*

Setup Test Environment
---------------
#./CrashConsistencyTest.sh setup_env

Run Tests
---------------
1)xfstests - runs "xfstests" as regression tests
#./CrashConsistencyTest.sh xfstests single generic/009
#./CrashConsistencyTest.sh xfstests all

2)verify_log_writes - verifies that dm-log-writes works properly
#./CrashConsistencyTest.sh verify_log_writes

3)consistency - checks the consistency of FS during a selected operation
#./CrashConsistencyTest.sh consistency all 
runs generic tests having no mkfs and checks consistency after each log replay

#./CrashConsistencyTest.sh consistency single 009 
runs generic test number 009 and checks consistency after each log replay

#./CrashConsistencyTest consistency db 
runs sysbench benchmark based on provided threads, records and transactions in
config file and checks consistency after each log replay

fsck_scripts
--------------
- fsck_snap.sh is a standard script for checking the consistency.
- fsck_snap_v2.sh is like fsck_snap.sh but collects the output of strace when
fsck runs to assure us the first run of fsck doesn't change the contents of 
the disk. 
- fsck_snap_f2fs_only.sh was developed to prove the CKPT sequence in f2fs (to 
verify the correctness of sanpshotting process in fsck_scripts),
and it is exclusive to it.
